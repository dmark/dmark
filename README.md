__The Day Job__

24 years in ... My background is in Unix & Linux system operations, networking, security, and identity & access management, going back to early Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics workstations, and the old Netscape suite of server side products. Add in a whole lot of Sun Microsystems stuff, and some IBM POWER + AIX.

More recently I helped lead my employer into cloud services and I now work primarily in digital identity with Auth0 and cloud service platforms including AWS and GCP.

__After Hours__

I'm a part-time undergraduate at Queen's University, ever so slowly chipping away at a B.A in Economics. I'm also an avid motorcyclist (#R1200GSLife), [bookworm](https://www.goodreads.com/drumboots) (mainly scifi and non-fiction), and [gamer](https://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiMark/), where I mostly play RPGs and way too much Destiny.

__My Github Projects__

I've been pretty idle of late. In particular my most significant project, a [command line interface](https://github.com/dmark/authzero) for @Auth0, has been stalled for a year or more. What can I say ... I work full-time and I'm a part-time undergrad!
