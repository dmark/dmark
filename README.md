### The Day Job

24 years in: My background is in Unix & Linux system operations, networking, security, and identity & access management, going back to early Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics workstations, and the old Netscape suite of server side products. Add in a whole lot of Sun Microsystems stuff, and some IBM POWER + AIX.

More recently I helped lead my employer into cloud services and I now work primarily in digital identity with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and cloud service platforms including [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com).

### After Hours

I'm a part-time undergraduate at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca), ever so slowly chipping away at a B.A in Economics. My main interests in Economics include tax policy, health care economics, and mathematical economics.

I'm also an avid motorcyclist (#R1200GSLife), [bookworm](https://www.goodreads.com/drumboots) (mainly sci-fi and non-fiction), and [gamer](https://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiMark/), where I mostly play RPGs and way too much Destiny.

### My GitHub Projects

My projects have been pretty idle of late. In particular my most significant project, a [command line interface](https://github.com/dmark/authzero) for Auth0, has been superceded by Auth0's [own solution](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli)!
