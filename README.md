# It Was the Best Butter

A Unix and Linux evangelist since before Slackware was Slackware, I began my career in system operations in 1996. The ever-present digital identity footnote to my career eventually took centre stage, and I now work at the intersection of digital trust & identity and cybersecurity, GRC, and privacy.

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on:

- A B.A. in [Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) at [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca),
- Upgrading my CISSP to a CISSP-ISSAP.

## My GitHub Projects

My projects have been pretty idle of late. In particular my most significant project, a [command line interface](https://github.com/dmark/authzero) for Auth0, is superceded by Auth0's [own solution](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli)!
