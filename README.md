# It Was the Best Butter

A Unix and Linux evangelist since before Slackware was Slackware, I began my career in system operations in 1996. I work on digital trust and identity. I am interested in where and how digital trust and identity supports and enables cybersecurity, GRC, and privacy.

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on:

- A B.A. in [Economics](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/) at [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca),
- Upgrading my CISSP to a CISSP-ISSAP.

👨‍🎓 I'm currently reading:

- George Orwell, _Selected Essays_.
- _Slice Me Some Truth_, a collection of Canadian creative non-fiction essays.
- Lee Gutkind, _You Can't Make This Stuff Up_, about how to write creative non-fiction.
- Steven Pinker, _The Sense of Style_, about how to write well.
- Augustine, _Confessions_.
- David Kahn, _The Codebreakers_.
- Auguste Kerckhoffs, _La Cryptographie Militaire_.

<!--## My GitHub Projects

My projects have been pretty idle of late. In particular my most significant project, a [command line interface](https://github.com/dmark/authzero) for Auth0, is superceded by Auth0's [own solution](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli)!
