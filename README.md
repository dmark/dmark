__The Day Job__

My background is in Unix & Linux system operations, networking, security, and identity & access management. These days I work primarily in digital identity and cloud service platforms including @Auth0, @AWS and @GoogleCloudPlatform.

__After Hours__

I'm an undergraduate in Economics at Queen's University, avid motorcyclist, [bookworm](https://www.goodreads.com/drumboots), and video game player.

__My Github Projects__

I've been pretty idle of late. In particular my most significant project, a [command line interface](https://github.com/dmark/authzero) for @Auth0, has been stalled for a year or more. What can I say ... I work full-time and I'm a part-time undergrad!
